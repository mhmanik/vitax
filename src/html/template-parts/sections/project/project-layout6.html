                                            would, doesn’t mean we have to stop taking pictures. There’s still plenty
                                            you can do, provided you're prepared to use some imagination. Here are a few
                                            ideas to keep you shooting until normal life resumes.</p>
                                        <p>Most photographers love to shoot the unusual, and you don’t get much more
                                            unusual than These Unprecedented Times. Right now everything counts as out
                                            of the ordinary. There are a number of remarkable things about these
                                            lockdown days that are worth photographing now so we can remember them when
                                            it is all over.</p>
                                        <p>Streets empty that are usually busy are remarkable and can evoke the sense of
                                            historical pictures from before the invention of the motorcar. Other things
                                            that are different at the moment will be queues to get into stores and the
                                            lines marked out on the floor to show how far apart we should be.</p>
